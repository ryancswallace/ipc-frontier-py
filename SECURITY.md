# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in `ipc-frontier-py`, please report it responsibly.

- **How to report**: Submit a private vulnerability report via the projectâ€™s [Security page](https://github.com/ryancswallace/ipc-frontier-py/security/advisories/new).
- **Do not open a public GitHub Issue** for security problems, as issues are visible to everyone.
- **Alternative contact**: If the Security page is unavailable, you may also email the maintainer at [ryancswallace@gmail.com](mailto:ryancswallace@gmail.com).

We will review and respond to all reports as quickly as possible. Please allow up to 5 business days for an initial response.
